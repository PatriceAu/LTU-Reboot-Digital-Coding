  Introduction to Web Development
  
  
  What have I learnt?

  How did I use this in practice?
  
  
  No practice so far
  
  What did I find hard?
  
  I find all the terminology which is new to me difficult.
I also find it difficult to follow the lessons on MS Teams and do the practical at the same time
