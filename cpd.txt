Introduction to Web Development


What have I learnt?

I learnt the different type of development (front end, back end, full stack):  I have learnt the 3 languages html, Javascript and css:  I have learnt what a repository and a text editor are   


How did I use this in practice?

No practice at the moment


What did I find hard?
I find all the terminology which is new to me difficult.
I also find it difficult to follow the lessons on MS Teams and do the practical at the same time
